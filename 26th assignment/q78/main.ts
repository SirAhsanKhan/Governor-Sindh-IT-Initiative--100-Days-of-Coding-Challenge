/*here there are 2 method to implement the function 
one is function decelaration(top one):in this we directly assign a function and then tell it what to do after that when we console we write function name

other one is function expression: in which we assign a variable and make  function in that variale 
so when we want to console we call varible  name
a bit tricky stil easyðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤”
